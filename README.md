# Brute_Force_Login_Investigation
This project demonstrates detection and investigation of a brute force login attack using Wazuh SIEM. A simulated attack from Kali Linux targeted Windows systems, generating failed (4625) and successful (4624) login events. Logs were analyzed to identify attacker behavior, IP, and patterns, followed by incident reporting and mitigation steps.
